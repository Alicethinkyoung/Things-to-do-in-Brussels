							<p>The City of Brussels (French: Ville de Bruxelles [vil də bʁysɛl] or alternatively Bruxelles-Ville [bʁysɛl vil]; Dutch: Stad Brussel [stɑd ˈbrʏsəl] or Brussel-Stad) is the largest municipality and historical centre of the Brussels-Capital Region, as well as the capital of Belgium.[2] The City of Brussels is also the administrative centre of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions in its European Quarter.[3][4][a]

Besides the central historic town located within the Pentagon, the City of Brussels covers some of the city's immediate outskirts within the greater Brussels-Capital Region, namely Haren, Laeken, and Neder-Over-Heembeek to the north, as well as the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan and the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos park to the south-east, where it borders municipalities in Flanders.

As of 1 January 2017, the City of Brussels had a total population of 176,545. The total area is 32.61 km2 (12.59 sq mi) which gives a population density of 5,475 inhabitants per square kilometre (14,180/sq mi). As of 2007, there were approximately 50,000 registered non-Belgians in the City of Brussels.[5] In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).</p>

							<p>The capital of Belgium, Brussels, is a fascinating place with stunning architecture and fascinating history packed into every street and alleyway. The vibe of the city is hard to put your finger on. Sometimes it seems very business and bureaucracy focused, it is after all the administerial centre of the EU, but at other times it feels laid back and does not take itself too seriously: think Manneken Pis and The Comic Strip Centre.

It is this multi-layered atmosphere that makes Brussels such a great city to visit. It truly has something for everyone and offers European staples such as art and architecture alongside more unusual attractions. Don’t visit Brussels if you are on a diet as the fries, mussels and beer will soon have you indulging.</p>

							<p>Brussels is Belgium’s quintessential capital city, full of Art Deco taverns, unique Flemish art, towering Gothic cathedrals, and quaint guild houses. Buzzing with activities all year around, discover the parks with blooming flowers, architectural monuments, historic culture and art while filling up on the famous Belgian chocolates and the huge choice of local beers. 

Brussels is also one of the best European cities to go shopping in thanks to its 19th-century shopping arcade. This arcade houses a range of high-end brands some of which have designed clothes for the Belgian Royal Family. The cobbled lanes of the city centre are lined with Michelin-starred restaurants and wood-panelled Art Deco brasseries. From what to eat and drink, to historical sights you shouldn’t miss out on, make the most of your holiday with our guide of things to do in Brussels.</p>
